It is\n\t * complicated, thus this doc is long and (hopefully) detailed enough to answer\n\t * your questions.\n\t *\n\t * If you need to react to the mouse wheel in a predictable way, this code is\n\t * like your bestest friend. * hugs *\n\t *\n\t * As of today, there are 4 DOM event types you can listen to:\n\t *\n\t *   'wheel'                -- Chrome(31+), FF(17+), IE(9+)\n\t *   'mousewheel'           -- Chrome, IE(6+), Opera, Safari\n\t *   'MozMousePixelScroll'  -- FF(3.5 only!) (2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n\t *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n\t *\n\t * So what to do?  The is the best:\n\t *\n\t *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n\t *\n\t * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n\t * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n\t *\n\t *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n\t *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n\t *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n\t *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n\t *\n\t * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n\t * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n\t * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n\t * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n\t * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n\t * linear speed or acceleration.\n\t *\n\t * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n\t *\n\t *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n\t *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n\t *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n\t *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n\t *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n\t *\n\t *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n\t *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n\t *     pixels!\n\t *\n\t *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n\t *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n\t *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n\t *\n\t * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n\t *\n\t *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n\t *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n\t *\n\t *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n\t *\n\t *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n\t *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n\t *     you know.\n\t *\n\t * Implementation info:\n\t *\n\t * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n\t * average mouse:\n\t *\n\t *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n\t *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n\t *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n\t *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n\t *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n\t *\n\t * On the trackpad:\n\t *\n\t *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n\t *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n\t *\n\t * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n\t * also missing delta values.\n\t *\n\t * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n\t *\n\t * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n\t *\n\t * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n\t * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.  Some browsers provide other values to maintain\n\t * backward compatibility with older events.  Those other values help us\n\t * better normalize spin speed.

You would typically create a\n * single instance of a `Transaction` for reuse multiple times, that potentially\n * is used to wrap several different methods. Wrappers are extremely simple -\n * they only require implementing two methods.\n *\n * <pre>\n *                       wrappers (injected at creation time)\n *                                      +        +\n *                                      |        |\n *                    +-----------------|--------|--------------+\n *                    |                 v        |              |\n *                    |      +---------------+   |              |\n *                    |   +--|    wrapper1   |---|----+         |\n *                    |   |  +---------------+   v    |         |\n *                    |   |          +-------------+  |         |\n *                    |   |     +----|   wrapper2  |--------+   |\n *                    |   |     |    +-------------+  |     |   |\n *                    |   |     |                     |     |   |\n *                    |   v     v                     v     v   | wrapper\n *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ | invariants\n * perform(anyMethod) | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | | maintained\n * +----------------->|-|---|-|---|-->|anyMethod|---|---|-|---|-|-------->\n *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ |\n *                    |  initialize                    close    |\n *                    +-----------------------------------------+\n * </pre>\n *\n * Use cases:\n * - Preserving the input selection ranges before/after reconciliation.\n *   Restoring selection even in the event of an unexpected error.\n * - Deactivating events while rearranging the DOM, preventing blurs/focuses,\n *   while guaranteeing that afterwards, the event system is reactivated.\n * - Flushing a queue of collected DOM mutations to the main UI thread after a\n *   reconciliation takes place in a worker thread.\n * - Invoking any collected `componentDidUpdate` callbacks after rendering new\n *   content.\n * - (Future use case): Wrapping particular flushes of the `ReactWorker` queue\n *   to preserve the `scrollTop` (an automatic scroll aware DOM).\n * - (Future use case): Layout calculations before and after DOM updates.\n *\n * Transactional plugin API:\n * - A module that has an `initialize` method that returns any precomputation.\n * - and a `close` method that accepts the precomputation. `close` is invoked\n *   when the wrapped process is completed, or has failed.\n *\n * @param {Array<TransactionalWrapper>} transactionWrapper Wrapper modules\n * that implement `initialize` and `close`.\n * @return {Transaction} Single transaction for reuse in thread.\n *\n * @class Transaction\n */\nvar Mixin = {\n  /**\n   * Sets up this instance so that it is prepared for collecting metrics.

It is\n * complicated, thus this doc is long and (hopefully) detailed enough to answer\n * your questions.\n *\n * If you need to react to the mouse wheel in a predictable way, this code is\n * like your bestest friend. * hugs *\n *\n * As of today, there are 4 DOM event types you can listen to:\n *\n *   'wheel'                -- Chrome(31+), FF(17+), IE(9+)\n *   'mousewheel'           -- Chrome, IE(6+), Opera, Safari\n *   'MozMousePixelScroll'  -- FF(3.5 only!) (2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n *\n * So what to do?  The is the best:\n *\n *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n *\n * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n *\n *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n *\n * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n * linear speed or acceleration.\n *\n * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n *\n *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n *\n *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n *     pixels!\n *\n *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n *\n * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n *\n *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n *\n *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n *\n *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n *     you know.\n *\n * Implementation info:\n *\n * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n * average mouse:\n *\n *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n *\n * On the trackpad:\n *\n *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n *\n * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n * also missing delta values.\n *\n * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n *\n * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n *\n * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.  Some browsers provide other values to maintain\n * backward compatibility with older events.  Those other values help us\n * better normalize spin speed.  Example of what the browsers provide:\n *\n *                          | event.wheelDelta | event.detail\n *        ------------------+------------------+--------------\n *          Safari v5/OS X  |       -120       |       0\n *          Safari v5/Win7  |       -120       |       0\n *         Chrome v17/OS X  |       -120       |       0\n *         Chrome v17/Win7  |       -120       |       0\n *                IE9/Win7  |       -120       |   undefined\n *         Firefox v4/OS X  |     undefined    |       1\n *         Firefox v4/Win7  |     undefined    |       3\n *\n */\nfunction normalizeWheel( /*object*/event) /*object*/{\n  var sX = 0,\n      sY = 0,\n      // spinX, spinY\n  pX = 0,\n      pY = 0; // pixelX, pixelY\n\n  // Legacy\n  if ('detail' in event) {\n    sY = event.detail;\n  }\n  if ('wheelDelta' in event) {\n    sY = -event.wheelDelta / 120;\n  }\n  if ('wheelDeltaY' in event) {\n    sY = -event.wheelDeltaY / 120;\n  }\n  if ('wheelDeltaX' in event) {\n    sX = -event.wheelDeltaX / 120;\n  }\n\n  // side scrolling on FF with DOMMouseScroll\n  if ('axis' in event && event.axis === event.HORIZONTAL_AXIS) {\n    sX = sY;\n    sY = 0;\n  }\n\n  pX = sX * PIXEL_STEP;\n  pY = sY * PIXEL_STEP;\n\n  if ('deltaY' in event) {\n    pY = event.deltaY;\n  }\n  if ('deltaX' in event) {\n    pX = event.deltaX;\n  }\n\n  if ((pX || pY) && event.deltaMode) {\n    if (event.deltaMode == 1) {\n      // delta in LINE units\n      pX *= LINE_HEIGHT;\n      pY *= LINE_HEIGHT;\n    } else {\n      // delta in PAGE units\n      pX *= PAGE_HEIGHT;\n      pY *= PAGE_HEIGHT;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Fall-back if spin cannot be determined\n  if (pX && !sX) {\n    sX = pX < 1 ? -1 : 1;\n  }\n  if (pY && !sY) {\n    sY = pY < 1 ? -1 : 1;\n  }\n\n  return { spinX: sX,\n    spinY: sY,\n    pixelX: pX,\n    pixelY: pY };\n}\n\n/**\n * The best combination if you prefer spinX + spinY normalization.
